# Shortest_Flight_Finder

## Overview: üó£Ô∏è  

This project models a network of possible flights between cities as a graph, where cities are nodes and flights (with distances or costs) are
edges. Once the network is loaded, the program can calculate the shortest route between any two cities based on total distance, cost, or time‚Äîdepending
on the data provided. Under the hood, it uses a shortest path algorithm (like Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm) to efficiently find the most optimal route between cities.
The project helps visualize how complex travel networks can be analyzed and optimized using graph-based techniques. At a high level, this project demonstrates
how concepts from graph theory and pathfinding algorithms can be used to solve real-world problems in transportation and logistics.
